According to the Venerable Bede, the pre-Christian Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians used a soli-lunar calendar. In his book, De Temporum Ratione, published in the 725, Bede lays out the rules by which this calendar worked, and the names of the months among the English peoples. I became curious how this calendar worked. So, using Bede's rules, I coded this Lunar calendar in Javascript. Because I could. Thanks, Bede.

Rule 1
Each month begins at the new moon. There are 12 months in a regular year, and 13 in an intercalary year.

Rule 2
The year begins with the new moon following the winter solstice.

Rule 3
Although the beginning of the year is linked to the winter solstice, the rule on intercalary months is governed by the summer solstice: If, within a fortnight following the summer solstice, a new moon occurs, the next new moon (i.e., the one that will happen approximately 29 days later) is an intercalary month (Trilitha), which occurs every three to five years, making it a 13 month year, which keeps the seasons aligned. This was especially important for an agricultural society.

For the purpose of saxon-date, I am using the Runic Era (RE) year. The RE is not a real thing. It basically just adds 250 years to the current Gregorian year. I wanted to use a year/era that was older than the current era to show that this traditional indigenous calendar, and the culture it is attached to, pre-dates the Christianization of Europe. However, since the Germanic peoples of northwest Europe were largely illiterate at that time, there does not seem to a historical era that fits the bill.
