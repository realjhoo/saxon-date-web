        The purpose of the Saxon Date project is to create a calendar that
        approximates the native calendar used by the Anglo-Saxon peoples at the
        point in time where they become visible to history. I am not attempting
        to be create precision, nor am I claiming that I have miraculously
        recovered the lost calendar of our ancestors. It is simply a way to
        represent time, which is tied to the seasons and rhythms of the natural
        world and that would have been familiar to my ancestors such that, if I
        told them that it was the third day of Ereyule, they would have a pretty
        good idea of what (when) I was talking about.
      </p>

      According to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bede">Venerable Bede</a>, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angles">Angles</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxons">Saxons</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutes">Jutes</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisians">Frisians</a> (see
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain"
        >here</a
      >) marked time with a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar"
        >lunisolar calendar</a
      >. In his book,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoning_of_Time"
        ><i>De Temporum Ratione</i></a
      >, published in 725, Bede gives us a general idea of how the ancient
      Anglo-Saxon calendar worked, along with the names of the months and a few
      references to holidays. Bede was not interested in reconstructing the
      pagan calendar of his ancestors, but was instead attempting to show that
      his ancestors were backward and uncivilized barbarians. This would allow
      him to give the impression that Christianity, and the universal culture
      that followed it, had brought progress and Truth to England. To the degree
      that he cared for the history of his own people, it was only as a tool to
      support the Church.

      <p>
        Nevertheless, using what information he gave, and supplementing it with
        what we know about the relatives of the Anglo-Saxons on the continent,
        we can arrive at a set of rules for a reconstructed Anglo-Saxon
        calendar, and then, using these rules, set about generating a Saxonish
        calendar date. This calendar, which I have rather unimaginatively called
        the Saxon Date, would then give us an approximation of what the date
        might have been, had the ancient Anglo-Saxon calendar survived in use
        among the Anglophonic peoples.
      </p>

      <p>
        These rules are based on what we know about
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Germanic_calendars"
          >ancient Germanic calendars</a
        >, and the bits that Bede has left us. Note that, for the purposes of
        this (or any other) lunisolar calendar, month and moon are
        interchangeable terms.
      </p>

      <span>
        <li>Rule 1</li>
        <p>
          Each month begins at the new moon. There are 12 months in a regular
          year, and 13 in an
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)"
            >intercalary year</a
          >.
        </p>
        <li>Rule 2</li>
        <p>The year begins with the new moon following the winter solstice.</p>
        <li>Rule 3</li>
        <p>
          Although the beginning of the year is linked to the winter solstice,
          the rule governing intercalary months is governed by the summer
          solstice. If a new moon occurs within a fortnight following the summer
          solstice, the next new moon (i.e., the one that occurs 29.5 days
          later) is an intercalary month, which Bede informs us was known as
          “Trilitha.” This should occur every three to five years, the purpose
          of which is to keep the seasons aligned with the calendar. This was
          especially important for an agricultural society.
        </p>
      </span>

      <p>
        For the purpose of Saxon Date, I am using the Runic Era (RE) year. The
        RE is not a real thing. It basically adds 250 years to the current
        Gregorian year. I wanted to use a year/era that was older than the
        current Christian era in order to show that this traditional indigenous
        calendar, and the culture in which it originates, predates the
        Christianization of Europe. However, since the Germanic peoples were
        largely illiterate at that time, there does not seem to be an historical
        era that fits the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings up a larger question regarding the use of numbers. The
        Saxons may not have seen the use in having each year assigned a unique
        number. Perhaps they would have appreciated a cycle of nine years, or
        numbering the years since the current king came to power. But, for my
        purpose, a year number needs to be assigned, and the RE is as good as
        any. As with the entire Saxon Date project, I am open to suggestions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, our way of citing the date, where we mention the name of
        the month, followed by the number of days that have elapsed since the
        month began, is a modern innovation. The Romans counted days before and
        after the middle of the month. Read about that here. The ancient English
        peoples may have preferred to note the moon phase, or count the number
        of weeks. The possibilities are endless. But, again, for my purposes,
        some amount of precision was desired. And, too, no matter how they cited
        the date in the 5th century, had the calendar survived, they would have,
        in all likelihood, began to count days, because it is super-convenient.
        I’ll note here, which I have elaborated on in more detail elsewhere,
        that I used the same approach with the month names. For example,
        “Eostre” is now pronounced “Easter”. It makes sense that this would have
        happened to the celebration and the name of the month simultaneously.
        For “Hretha”, I dropped the initial “H”, as that seems to be the way
        English has developed. I also dropped the “month” suffix. I open to
        reasons why this was wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: For Rule 3, I initially read a source that the year was
        intercalary if a new moon occurred within 14 (or possibly 12) days
        following the summer solstice. So far, this appears to produce too many
        intercalary years. This rule needs a tweak, but I have not had time to
        have a think about it yet. Suggestions welcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note #2: Saxon Date calculates the date of the last winter solstice,
        then, using math, approximates the date of the next new moon, which it
        labels "Afteryule". The months (new moons) then follow in order, as
        described by Bede. The program also calculates the date of the summer
        solstice, and, if a new moon follows within 14 days, adds an extra month
        in the middle of the sequence (Trilitha). There is a lot of room for
        error in these calculations. The new moon especially is subject to a
        non-cumulative error of a day or two each month. This unintentionally
        mimics the situation in a real observational calendar, where the dates
        could not be set until the new moon actually happened. Only after the
        introduction of writing could information be accurately recorded, and
        the 19-year
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle"
          >Metonic (link) cycle</a
        >
        discovered. That, I believe, allowed for an essentially perpetual
        calendar, giving our ancestors the ability to plan any dates for any
        time in the future (or the past, for that matter).
      </p>
      <p>Note #3: I may recast this calendar using the Metonic cycle.</p>
