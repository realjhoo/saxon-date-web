        As you may have realized, I am interested in measuring time and this is
        what fueled my interest in Beat Time, which is essentially a form of
        decimal time such that the day is arbitrarily divided into 1,000 units,
        called beats. More about this can be read
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time"> here</a>.
        If the measurement of time can be reformed in this way, then it stands
        to reason that dates could also be decimalized, giving us a system
        completely devoid of connections to Earth's natural cycles, a system of
        reckoning dates that will work across the future galactic empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beat time is universal and only coincidentally coincides with
        terrestrial time. Measuring time with 'beats' results in the
        accumulation of days. This accumulation of days I will term "Ad Numerare
        Dierum" (ND), literally, "the count of days". The ND includes the
        fractional part of the day in Beat Time after the "@" sign. Luckily,
        this concept already exists in the form of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day">Julian Day</a>, which
        is simply the count of days, starting with 0, since 1 January 4713 BCE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this standard, the current (when I wrote this on 24 February 2021)
        Julian Day is 2459270, which, as I indicated, represents the count of
        days since 4713 BCE. In order to make this number more "user friendly"
        and format it into chunks that we can remember, I divided the ND into
        Trienniums, Melias and Centums (yes, there is a Latin theme developing
        here). Each Triennium represents the span of about 2.7 solar years. The
        current Triennium, represented by the leftmost 4 digits of the Julian
        Day, is 2459.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melias represent groups of 100 days. There are, naturally, 10 of these
        groups. Each Melia is named so that they can be used much like months,
        although they are more than three times longer. The Melias are:
      </p>
      <li>Nullamelia</li>
      <li>Unumelia</li>
      <li>Duomelia</li>
      <li>Triamelia</li>
      <li>Quattarmelia</li>
      <li>Quinquemelia</li>
      <li>Sexmelia</li>
      <li>Septmelia</li>
      <li>Octomelia</li>
      <li>Novemelia</li>
      <p>
        So, on 2459270, it is Duomelia, and it will remain so for another 29
        days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two rightmost digits represent the "Centum". The Centum on 2459270
        is 70. The day after Centum 99 is Centum 00, and the Centum increments
        at @000 beats.
      </p>
      <p>
        The illogical and mismatched groupings of time that once tracked the
        seasons is fine for local use, and for its original purpose, tracking
        seasons, religious feasts, holy days and holidays, but it will never
        make sense for time on Mars or Proxima Centauri, or two people on
        opposite sides of our planet trying to schedule a Zoom meeting, to track
        the time with 12 months, each consisting of a random number of days
        making up a year that is 365.25 days long with each day further broken
        down into two sets of twelve, each subdivided into 60ths, which are
        themselves divided into 60ths again.
      </p>

        Nothing will ever come of it. But its fun to think about. And, if I ever
        write a fictional story of a fictional empire in an alternate timeline,
        they will tell time in two ways. Each culture will have its own
        traditional calendar, driven by seasons and natural rhythms. And, the
        larger group will have a way of dealing with time between cultures. Like
        Esperanto... but for time. But more like Toki Pona.
